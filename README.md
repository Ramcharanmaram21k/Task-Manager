# 🚀 Task Manager – THworks Assignment

Welcome to my Task Manager web app! This is my take on the classic productivity tool, built for the THworks full-stack JavaScript challenge. You can add, update, analyze, and even delete your tasks—all in a clean, modern, fast interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Add Your Tasks:** Enter what you need to get done, give it a title, fill in a description, set a priority and a due date.
- **See Everything At A Glance:** Instantly see your tasks, what’s open, what’s in progress, and what’s done.
- **Smart Insights:** The top panel gives you a friendly workload summary—a mini "AI touch" that analyzes how busy (or chill) your week is!
- **Update and Complete:** Mark tasks as done, bump up priority, or start/reopen them with a simple click.
- **Delete Tasks:** If something’s no longer relevant, just toss it with a click of the trash icon.
- **Filter Like A Pro:** Fine-tune your view by status or priority and find what matters most—fast.
- **Beautiful & Responsive:** Comes with a gradient insights bar, dark theme, and a simple layout for focus and clarity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + SQLite (super-fast, portable database)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Custom CSS (and a bit of SVG icon love)
- **RESTful API:** For smooth, modern data flow
- **Deployed on Vercel:** So you can use it live, no code required!

## 📚 About This Project

This was created solo, from scratch, as a hands-on test of full-stack skills. All code is documented and structured for clarity. The insights panel is all algorithmic logic (no LLMs or magic behind the curtain).

If you spot a bug or think the insights text could get even smarter, just drop me a note or raise an issue!

**Made for THworks. Designed for anyone who wants to get more done—with zero friction.**
